# Cortex Electron App UI/UX Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the UI/UX components of the Cortex Electron application, focusing on the design principles, component structure, and user interaction patterns.

## Design Principles

- **Consistency**: The application follows a consistent design language across all components, ensuring a cohesive user experience.
- **Responsiveness**: The UI is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Accessibility**: Accessibility features are integrated to ensure the application is usable by people with varying abilities.
- **Usability**: The interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear labels and instructions.

## Component Structure

The UI is built using React, with components organized in a modular structure to promote reusability and maintainability.

- **Main Application Component (`src/app.tsx`)**: Serves as the entry point for the React application, managing the overall layout and routing.
- **Components Directory (`src/components/`)**: Contains reusable UI components, such as buttons, forms, and modals.
- **Styles Directory (`src/styles/`)**: Contains global and component-specific styles, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling.

## User Interaction Patterns

- **Navigation**: The application uses a sidebar navigation pattern, allowing users to easily switch between different sections.
- **Feedback**: Interactive elements provide immediate feedback, such as hover effects and loading indicators, to enhance user experience.
- **Forms and Input**: Forms are designed with clear labels and validation to guide users through data entry processes.

## Future Considerations

- **State Management**: Consider implementing a state management solution for better handling of complex UI states.
- **Testing**: Add UI testing infrastructure to ensure components behave as expected across different scenarios.
- **Internationalization**: Plan for supporting multiple languages to reach a broader audience.

## API Key Input Design

To facilitate user input of API keys for OpenAI or Anthropic, the following UI design is proposed:

- **Form Layout**: A dedicated section or modal for API key input, accessible from the settings or configuration menu.
- **Input Fields**: Labeled input fields for "OpenAI API Key" and "Anthropic API Key" with placeholder text indicating the expected format.
- **Validation**: Real-time validation to check the format of the API keys, providing immediate feedback for invalid inputs.
- **Security**: Masked input fields to hide API keys as they are typed, similar to password fields.
- **Save and Cancel Buttons**: Buttons to save the entered keys or cancel the operation, with the "Save" button enabled only when input is valid.
- **Feedback**: Feedback upon saving, such as success or error messages, using toast notifications or inline messages.
- **Help and Instructions**: A help icon or link to documentation explaining where to find and how to use the API keys.
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels and keyboard navigation support, including ARIA attributes, to ensure accessibility.

This design ensures a user-friendly and secure method for users to input their API keys, with guidance and feedback to assist them in the process.

This document serves as a guide for understanding the UI/UX architecture of the Cortex Electron application, providing insights into its design and interaction patterns.
